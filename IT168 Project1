		// WHY THE BELOW HAPPENED:
		// I originally thought I had a rounding error because of "double"
		// because the numbers were "rounding". Later, I realized I forgot the
		// parathesis in end-initial which solved the whole issue.

		// Note1: Without Math.round, Java seems to always round down. 

		// Note2: Initially, I tried doing this the exponential way:
		// But realized I should just code the program in a way I understand.
		// double annualReturn = Math.pow(totalReturn,exp);
		// double totalReturn=(total/100-1)*100;
		// double annualReturn = totalReturn*holdingPeriodYears;
		// double exp = 1/NumOfYears;
		// double annualReturn = (growthRate / holdingPeriodYears)-1*100; //failed
		// attempt in getting to percentage form

		// double totalReturn1 = (((end-initial / initial)/100)-1)*100;
		// double totalReturn=Math.abs(totalReturn1); //sometimes when using low
		// numbers, the return ends up becoming negative?
